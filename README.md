## Description

The purpose of this application is to help people find reputable charities who are doing great work for causes around the world. 

This React single-page application was built using Performant JS, a NoSQL database, service workers to make it a progressive web application, we also used Apollo GraphQL, Concurrent servers and JWT for Authentication.

Mobile-first design is built on the fact that users increasingly use their mobile devices to interact with web applications. An application that provides users with the best performance and flexibility is likely to win out over its competitors.
